Hi, I’m Arjun Bahati and I'm currently learning how to become a full-stack web developer. Currently working on learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript to have a solid foundation for front and back-end development.
I’m interested in all kinds of development right now, hoping to find something that really gets my attention. If anyone has silly projects or games in mind, I would really enjoy collaborating or bouncing around ideas. 
It's easiest to reach me through my discord 'iamthatdude'.
